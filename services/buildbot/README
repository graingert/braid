This is the configuration for buildbot.twistedmatrix.com's buildmaster.

It is installed in `/srv/bb-master` as user `bb-master`.

It uses the following directories:

~/config - This repository
~/config/master - The buildbot configuration
~/bin - commands to start and stop the server
~/log - log files
~/run - pid files
~/data - buildbot data
~/private - private configuration
~/data/state.sqlite - buildbot's db
~/data/dependencies/ - dependencies for cpython and pypy builders
~/data/build_products - built packages and build output

Note: http.log is located in ~/data

To set up the staging version run:

    fab config.vagrant buildslave.install
    fab config.vagrant buildslave.installTestData

The slave database used for testing from `master/private.py.sample` might
get out of sync from the one used in production and which is hosted at
`/srv/bb-master/private/private.py`.

You can attach the testing slave which servers all builders by running::

    fab config.vagrant buildslave.start
